      <p>If you have acne-prone or oily skin and live in Kenya, skipping sunscreen is one of the fastest ways to make dark marks worse and delay healing. The strong equatorial sun combined with high humidity means that any inflammation from pimples can quickly turn into stubborn brown or purple spots that last for months or even years on melanin-rich skin. Many people avoid sunscreen because they think it will make their skin oilier or cause breakouts — but the right matte, non-comedogenic formulas actually help control oil and protect healing skin.</p>

      <p>After helping hundreds of Kenyans through messages and seeing real results, I’ve narrowed down the sunscreens that consistently work best in our climate. These are all widely available, have good reviews from people with oily/acne-prone skin, and don’t leave a white cast or greasy feel.</p>

      <!-- Case Study 1 -->
      <h2>Real Story: Aisha, 24, Nairobi</h2>
      <p>Aisha had been struggling with acne for 3 years. Her cheeks and forehead were full of small bumps and she had many dark marks from previous breakouts. She avoided sunscreen because “it makes my skin shiny and causes more pimples”. After switching to La Roche-Posay Anthelios Oil Control SPF 50 every morning (and reapplying at lunch), her new dark marks stopped forming within 3 weeks and existing ones started fading after 8 weeks. Her skin is now much less oily by midday. “I wish I started earlier,” she says.</p>

      <h2>Top Recommended Matte Sunscreens (2026)</h2>

      <h3>1. La Roche-Posay Anthelios Oil Control SPF 50+ Dry Touch</h3>
      <p>The most recommended sunscreen for acne-prone skin in Kenya right now. It has a true dry-touch finish that controls oil for 6–8 hours even in humid weather. No white cast on medium to deep skin tones. Non-comedogenic and fragrance-free. Price: KES 4,000 – 6,000 at MYDAWA, Goodlife, Haltons and Jumia.</p>

      <h3>2. Eucerin Oil Control Dry Touch SPF 50</h3>
      <p>Excellent oil-absorbing technology. Many users with oily skin in Mombasa and Nairobi say it keeps their face matte until evening. Lightweight, no pilling under makeup. Price: KES 3,000 – 4,500.</p>

      <h3>3. Bioderma Photoderm AKN Mat SPF 30</h3>
      <p>Specifically made for acne-prone skin. It mattifies, reduces shine and has ingredients that help control sebum. Very good for people who get shiny quickly. Price: KES 3,500 – 5,000.</p>

      <h3>4. Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch SPF 50</h3>
      <p>Budget-friendly and effective. Dry-touch formula that many students and young professionals love. Good starter sunscreen. Price: KES 2,000 – 3,000.</p>

      <!-- Case Study 2 -->
      <h2>Real Story: Kevin, 29, Mombasa</h2>
      <p>Kevin had moderate acne with lots of dark marks on his cheeks and jawline. He used to skip sunscreen because “it feels heavy in this heat”. After starting Eucerin Oil Control SPF 50 every morning, his skin stopped getting new dark spots and the existing ones lightened noticeably after 10 weeks. He now re-applies at 1pm when he’s on site. “My face stays matte even after sweating,” he says.</p>

      <h2>How to Use Sunscreen Correctly for Acne-Prone Skin in Kenya</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Use about 2 finger-lengths for face and neck</li>
        <li>Apply as the last step in your morning routine (after moisturizer and treatment)</li>
        <li>Reapply every 2–3 hours if you’re outdoors, sweating, or wearing a mask</li>
        <li>Choose tinted versions if you want light coverage and better match for deeper skin tones</li>
        <li>Always combine with a good moisturizer — sunscreen on dry skin can look patchy</li>
      </ul>

      <p style="margin-top:2.5rem;">Sunscreen is the single most important step for preventing and fading dark marks in Kenya. The right matte formula won’t make your acne worse — it will actually help your skin heal better.</p>
